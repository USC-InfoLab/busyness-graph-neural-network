This repository hosts the implementation of our Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN) framework for predicting visits to Points-of-Interest (POIs) by leveraging a comprehensive set of contextual signals, as introduced in the above paper. By capturing the complex interplay between spatial, temporal, semantic, and taxonomic contexts, BysGNN model significantly improves the accuracy of POI visit forecasting.

> **Important Note:**  
> The data used in this project is from the SafeGraph (private) dataset. If you have access to this dataset, you can use the BysGNN model as described in this repository by changing the arguments in `main.py` to point to the correct dataset directories.
> 
> For those who want to see an implementation of BysGNN on an open dataset, please check the implementation in the [NeuroGNN repository](https://github.com/USC-InfoLab/NeuroGNN/).
